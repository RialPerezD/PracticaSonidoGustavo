In this project, the OpenAL and SoftAL audio libraries are used, along with the ESAT graphics library.

This project serves as a demonstrator for the practical components, including:
	-Crossfading, applied during the transition between day and night, as well as when entering and exiting the tavern.
	-Layering, implemented through birds or enemies by playing multiple audio tracks simultaneously.

To compile the project, run the script ./tools/genProyect.bat.
To run the project, open the solution located at ./build/GameGustavo.sln and set "Game" as the startup project.
